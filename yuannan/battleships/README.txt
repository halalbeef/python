Hello!
My name is Yuannan Lin
and I'm a 15 year old budding programmer, I program in Python,
Bash, JS, HTML and abit of php and css.

This is "my first game" (that I have pushed to github anyway)
It's a "nice" game that allows you to pick the grid on how big
you wish to play, and then genrates ONE ship. I have an idea
on how to add more but it'll be a hassle to inplement. I am
currently learning on codecademy.com and will be adding to my
github as I finish more courses. Feel free to mod this game.
Not like I have a licence on it or anything.
srlsy tho
Have fun :)
